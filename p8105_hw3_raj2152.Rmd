## Problem 1

### Load the Instacart data for `p8105.datasets`
```{r}
data("instacart")
```

The Instacart dataset has `r nrow(instacart)` observations and `r ncol(instacart)` variables. Each row or observation corresponds to a single product within an Instacart order, therefore, one order may map to several products (i.e., there is a one-to-many relationship between orders and products). The variables provide details on each order, including things like `order_id` and `product_id` as well as the `user_id` of who placed the order. The variables also include information on where each product is located, for example: `aisle` and `department`.
