## Problem 1

### Load the Instacart data for `p8105.datasets`

``` r
data("instacart")
```

### Exploring the Instacart dataset

``` r
eda = instacart %>% 
  group_by(department) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_obs))

eda %>%   
  ggplot(aes(x = n_obs, y = department)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Exploring the data", 
    x = "Number of items ordered",
    y = "Department"
    )
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_raj2152_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />

``` r
eda2 = instacart %>% 
  group_by(user_id) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n())
```

From my brief exploration, the following departments are the most
popular: produce, dairy eggs, snacks, beverages, and frozen. From my
plot, the produce department appears to exceed the other departments by
nearly double. Also, there are 131209 user ID’s in this dataset.

*Write a short description of the dataset.* The Instacart dataset has
1384617 observations and 15 variables. Each row or observation
corresponds to a single product within an Instacart order, therefore,
one order may map to several products (i.e., there is a one-to-many
relationship between orders and products). The variables provide details
on each order, including things like `order_id` and `product_id` as well
as the `user_id` of who placed the order. The variables also include
information on where each product is located, for example: `aisle` and
`department`.

### Popular Aisles

*How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?* There are 134 aisles. The aisles with the most items ordered from
are: fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged vegetables fruits, yogurt,
and packaged cheese.

``` r
aisle_df = 
  instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  rename(quantity = n)
```

### Plotting Number of Items Ordered by Aisle, where number of items is greater than 10,000

*Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.*

``` r
aisle_df %>% 
  filter(quantity > 10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = quantity, y = reorder(aisle, quantity))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Items Ordered in Each Aisle (>10,000)",
    x = "Number of Items Ordered",
    y = "Aisle"
  )
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_raj2152_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="90%" />

This plot shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this
to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. The plot is in descending
order based on quantity.

### Popular Items by Aisles

*Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.*

``` r
target = c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")

instacart %>% 
  select(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% target) %>%
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  slice(1:3) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |

### Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream

*Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).*

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  select(product_name, order_hour_of_day, order_dow) %>% 
  arrange(order_dow) %>% 
  mutate(order_dow = recode(order_dow, `0` = "Sunday", `1` = "Monday", `2` = "Tuesday", `3` = "Wednesday", `4` = "Thursday", `5` = "Friday", `6` = "Saturday")) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "order_dow",
    values_from = "order_hour_of_day",
    values_fn = mean
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

| product\_name    | Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday |
|:-----------------|-------:|-------:|--------:|----------:|---------:|-------:|---------:|
| Pink Lady Apples |  13.44 |  11.36 |   11.70 |     14.25 |    11.55 |  12.78 |    11.94 |
| Coffee Ice Cream |  13.77 |  14.32 |   15.38 |     15.32 |    15.22 |  12.26 |    13.83 |

## Problem 2

First, load the `BRFSS` dataset…

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

Then, clean the dataset…

``` r
brfss_df = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(state = locationabbr, location = locationdesc) %>% 
  filter(
    topic == "Overall Health", 
    response %in% c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")
    ) %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"), ordered = TRUE))
```

### States with 7 or more locations

*In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
in 2010?*

``` r
state02 = 
  brfss_df %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  filter(n >= 7)

state10 =
  brfss_df %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  filter(n >= 7)
```

In **2002**, there were 36 states that were observed at 7 or more
locations, including: AZ, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, KS, LA,
MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, NC, NE, NH, NJ, NV, NY, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, SC,
SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, WA.

And in **2010** there were 45 states with 7 or more locations observed:
AL, AR, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, LA, MA, MD,
ME, MI, MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, ND, NE, NH, NJ, NM, NV, NY, OH, OK, OR, PA,
RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, WA, WY

### Excellent responses

*Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value
across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average
value over time within a state*

``` r
excell_df =
  brfss_df %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  mutate(meandv = mean(data_value)) %>% 
  select(year, state, meandv) %>% 
  distinct(state, .keep_all = TRUE)

excell_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = meandv, group = state, color = state)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  geom_line(aes(group = state), alpha = .3) +
  scale_color_discrete() +
  labs(
    title = "Average data value over time by state",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Data Value"
  )
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_raj2152_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="90%" />

From the plot above, the average data values appear to hover around
20-25. From 2002 to 2010, there appears to be a general decrease in
average data values over time.

### Distribution of data\_value for Poor to Excellent in NY State

*Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State.*

``` r
brfss_df %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2006, 2010), state == "NY") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value, color = response)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(. ~ year) +
  labs(
    title = " Distribution of data value responses in NY State, 2006 and 2010",
    x = "Response",
    y = "Data Value"
  )
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_raj2152_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="90%" />

The median values and interquartile range of the data values in each
response group appear to be similar across both years. The data values
are lowest for the poor response group, followed by fair, excellent,
good, and then very good being the highest.

## Problem 3

Load and tidy the accel\_data.csv dataset…

``` r
accel_df = 
  read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minute_of_day",
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    values_to = "activity"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    day_type = ifelse(day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday"),
    day_type = factor(day_type),
    day = factor(day, levels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"), ordered = TRUE),
    minute_of_day = as.numeric(minute_of_day)
  )
```

There are 6 variables in the `accel_df` dataframe including: activity,
day, day\_id, day\_type, minute\_of\_day, week. Each row of the dataset
includes the 63 year-old male’s activity counts at each minute of a
24-hour day. The dataset includes 50400 observations.

### Total activity counts for each day

*Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to
create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table
showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?*

``` r
agg_day_df =
  accel_df %>% 
  group_by(day_id) %>% 
  mutate(total_day_activity = sum(activity)) %>% 
  distinct(day_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  select(-activity, -minute_of_day) %>% 
  relocate(day_type, .after = day) 

agg_day_df %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| week | day\_id | day       | day\_type | total\_day\_activity |

|    3 |      15 | Friday    | weekday   |            467420.00 |
|    3 |      16 | Monday    | weekday   |            685910.00 |
|    3 |      17 | Saturday  | weekend   |            382928.00 |

|    3 |      21 | Wednesday | weekday   |            468869.00 |
|    4 |      22 | Friday    | weekday   |            154049.00 |
|    4 |      23 | Monday    | weekday   |            409450.00 |
|    4 |      24 | Saturday  | weekend   |              1440.00 |
|    4 |      25 | Sunday    | weekend   |            260617.00 |
|    4 |      26 | Thursday  | weekday   |            340291.00 |
|    4 |      27 | Tuesday   | weekday   |            319568.00 |
|    4 |      28 | Wednesday | weekday   |            434460.00 |
|    5 |      29 | Friday    | weekday   |            620860.00 |
|    5 |      30 | Monday    | weekday   |            389080.00 |
|    5 |      31 | Saturday  | weekend   |              1440.00 |
|    5 |      32 | Sunday    | weekend   |            138421.00 |
|    5 |      33 | Thursday  | weekday   |            549658.00 |
|    5 |      34 | Tuesday   | weekday   |            367824.00 |
|    5 |      35 | Wednesday | weekday   |            445366.00 |

From this table, we see that activity tends to be lower on weekends than
on weekdays.

### 24-hour activity for each day of the week

*Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of
the day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph.*

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute_of_day, y = activity, color = day)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .4) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(group = day)) + 
  labs(
    title = "24-hour Activity for Each Day of Week", 
    x = "Minute of the 24-hour day",
    y = "Activity counts"
  )
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_raj2152_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="90%" />

From the plot, we can see that activity for this 63 year old male begins
a little after minute 250 of the day (approx 4-5 am) and peaks and
decreases around minute 1250 of the day (approx 8pm). The times of the
day with the most activity are around minute 750 (approx 12:30pm) and
between minute 1000-1250 (approx 4-8pm). Additionally, activity starts
later in the morning on Sunday and there is more activity at night on
Friday.
