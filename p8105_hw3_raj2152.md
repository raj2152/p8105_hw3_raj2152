## Problem 1

### Load the Instacart data for `p8105.datasets`

``` r
data("instacart")
```

The Instacart dataset has 1384617 observations and 15 variables. Each
row or observation corresponds to a single product within an Instacart
order, therefore, one order may map to several products (i.e., there is
a one-to-many relationship between orders and products). The variables
provide details on each order, including things like `order_id` and
`product_id` as well as the `user_id` of who placed the order. The
variables also include information on where each product is located, for
example: `aisle` and `department`.
